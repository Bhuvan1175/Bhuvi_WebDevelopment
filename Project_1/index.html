        <h1>Hello Guys </h1>
        <h2>Bhuvi Bagde Here !!</h2>

        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p>
            <img src="Image/Bhuvi.jpg" height=400>My name is Bhuvaneshwar Bagde. I am a senior in high school. Everyone
            can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favorite subjects are chemistry and biology.
            I am going to enter the university because my goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a
            respected professional in one of the fields.
            I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many
            friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new intere
            sting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and
            ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time.
            I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a
            strong point of mine.
            My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet
            new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them
            I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find
            many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate
            friendship and people who surround me.
            Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but
            also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. Many of those friends who surroun
            d me now I met on the street while doing my hobby. I’m in love with photography, so the thing I love doing
            so much became even more enjoyable. I decided to take beautiful pictures of accidental
            people and share these photos with them by emails or in social media. I feel happiness inside seeing how
            happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or sitting somewhere in the park.
            In this way, Liza became my best friend and we both believe that we meant to meet because she studies the
            same classes and we have similar life goals.
            The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes
            with myself. Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exa
            ctly what made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help
            me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that
            it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I
            already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they
            feel like living as well.
